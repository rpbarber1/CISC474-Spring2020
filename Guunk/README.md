Guunk is a simple web game. It is completely processed client side, (no back-end or server implemented).
  The user plays as a slime blob trying to get to a star. The game starts with a start screen and start
  button. The player moves through the obstacles and their position is reset if they touch the green
  slime without the boot power up or fall off into the lava. The player can pick up power-ups
  described below. If the player "dies" and they retain power-ups picked up prior. Once the player
  reaches the star, they win and a win screen comes up.
  
  Power-Ups:
  
    Boot: allows player to walk on green slime
    
    Up Arrow: allows player to double jump
    
    Hang Glider: allows player to glide while holding 'shift' key
    
  Controls:
  
    w,a,s,d or arrow keys to move
    
    'shift' to glide with power-up
    
    double tap 'w' to double jump with power-up
